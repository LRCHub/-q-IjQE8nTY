This love is getting
kinda dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My mind. It's turning
like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run
Oh, oh, oh
If you want a cowboy
on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda
love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl,
I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
White horse
Someday,
maybe you could have your way
Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's
just got to do
I wish you could change my mind
Oh, oh, oh
If you want a cowboy
on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda
love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl,
I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
White horse
If you want a cowboy
on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda
love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl,
I ain't there
If you want a cowboy
on a white horse
Riding off into the sunset
If that's the kinda
love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl,
I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
White horse
