[00:21.17] Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
[00:25.21] Comes out just when you need it to
[00:31.46] As I paced back and forth all this time
[00:35.49] 'Cause I honestly believed in you
[00:41.09] Holdin' on, the days drag on
[00:45.77] Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known
[01:10.27] 
[00:50.00] That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
[00:55.73] I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
[00:59.31] Lead her up the stairwell
[01:01.51] This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
[01:06.28] I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
[01:11.80] Now it's too late for you and your white horse
[01:17.26] To come around
[01:24.26] 
[01:23.75] Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
[01:28.25] And never really had a chance
[01:34.05] My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
[01:37.98] You had to fight to have the upper hand
[01:43.32] I had so many dreams about you and me
[01:48.22] Happy endings, now I know
[02:00.72] 
[01:52.83] I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
[01:58.08] I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
[02:01.63] Lead her up the stairwell
[02:03.70] This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
[02:08.43] I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
[02:13.94] Now it's too late for you and your white horse
[02:18.99] To come around
[02:25.99] 
[02:30.87] And there you are on your knees
[02:36.05] Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
[02:41.19] Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
[03:02.19] 
[02:49.53] 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
[02:55.17] I'm gonna find someone someday
[02:58.16] Who might actually treat me well
[03:01.25] This is a big world, that was a small town
[03:05.43] There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now
[03:11.05] And it's too late for you and your white horse
[03:16.24] Now it's too late for you and your white horse
[03:21.71] To catch me now
[03:29.21] 
[03:26.46] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
[03:30.77] Try and catch me now, oh
[03:38.42] It's too late
[03:42.28] To catch me now
